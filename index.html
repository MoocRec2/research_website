                                With the development of MOOCs (Massive Open Online Courses) as a major source of
                                e-learning materials, the number of
                                MOOCs available today has become dauntingly high. Furthermore, MOOCs are produced in
                                many different video production
                                styles and these styles play an important role in helping the consumer stay engaged and
                                interested in the course
                                throughout. However, due to the sheer number of MOOCs available today, it is becoming
                                increasing difficult to find
                                the MOOCs that suits your personal preferences and the learning style. This paper
                                describes how thousands of MOOCs
                                that belong to different styles are identified efficiently while each consumer’s
                                preferences are identified to
                                provide personalized MOOC recommendations. Furthermore, the paper describes how forums
                                can be analyzed to identify
                                how consumers feel about MOOCs that they followed, which is a crucial metric in
                                recommending MOOCs to consumers.

                                Even though MOOCRec V1 has introduced a set of key features that were not present in any
                                other tool
                                a year ago,
                                through literature review we identified a set of key areas that can be improved or
                                extended along
                                with a new feature
                                that is not present in MOOCRec V1. Also, during the phase of literature review, there
                                were no other
                                tools that
                                matched the feature set offered by MOOCRec V1; which led us to compare MOOCRec V1 and
                                our solution,
                                which is
                                referred to as MOOCRec V2.
                                In areas such as processing, using resources optimally is an area that MOOCRec V1 has
                                not covered.
                                Also, it was
                                clear that newer video styles can be introduced to broaden the number of recommendations
                                that can be
                                provided across
                                a range of learning dimensions. Furthermore, how the learning-dimension/style of a user
                                is
                                identified is another
                                aspect that could be improved. Lastly, by adding forum analysis to strengthen how MOOCs
                                are
                                recommended to users, we
                                will be improving, and extending the user-experience, performance and functionality in
                                our solution,

                                As more and more people across the world adopt e-learning platforms to increase their
                                knowledge and
                                gain
                                certifications, Massive Open Online Courses have come to the spotlight for their
                                openness and scale.
                                Along with
                                that, search engines and review sites solely focusing on MOOCs emerged to help people
                                find MOOCs
                                that belong their
                                field of study easily.
                                However, most services that offer MOOCs like Coursera, Edx and search engine platforms
                                like Class
                                Central only take
                                a person’s interest in a certain field of study or a certification into account when
                                filtering or
                                recommending
                                MOOCs. However, a service called MOOCRec has done a great deal to bridge this gap
                                between finding a
                                MOOC that not
                                only matches a person’s field of study but also their personal learning style.
                                Furthermore, MOOCs
                                belong to a wide
                                range of video styles in which they are delivered such as animations, presentation
                                slides, etc. This
                                present a
                                dilemma to a consumer as to which MOOC to choose since some video styles may appeal to a
                                consumer
                                more than the
                                other.
                                While MOOCRec achieves many aspects of providing personalized recommendations based on
                                individual
                                learning styles,
                                we have found a set of areas where the approaches can be further improved while
                                introducing a new
                                set of features to
                                solidify the recommendation process by factoring in sentiments of MOOC consumers. To
                                elaborate
                                further, we
                                identified that we can improve upon the process of identifying the individual learning
                                style of a
                                person which is
                                done in terms of a lengthy Questionnaire in the existing product, MOOCRec V1.
                                Therefore, our research problem revolves around coming up with a more precise and
                                elegant way to
                                identify a person’s
                                individual learning style(s) and cover a broad range of MOOC video styles in order to
                                increase the
                                number of
                                individual learning styles that can be supported by MOOCRec V2 service.
